	Hello everyone. Today I'd like you to meet Rémy, our everlasting jaded member. Despite that he's always
ready to adapt to the team even so he doesn't really value his work. 
	About Rémy. Former baker and ambulance driver, he spent 4 months in Ireland and 1 day with a snake in his shoe as a woofer before returning
to France to undertake a skills assessment. That's why he's here with us today, but without a snake in his shoe this time. For him, English
doesn't ring any bell but he's determinate to get the title. With it, he'll join some IT companies to gain experience and improve his skills.
After that, he wish to go freelance.
